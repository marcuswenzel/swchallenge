Ressupply Calculation for Travel between Planets

## Background

In the world of Star Wars a StarShip, also known as a starcruiser, spaceship, spacecraft, or simply just craft or ship, was a vessel designed for interstellar travel, specifically between star systems.

Each StarShip has specific autonomy and needs from time to time to stop for ressupply.

The objective of the application is calculate how many stops for resupply are required, to cover a given distance.

Distances are measured in mega lights (MGLT) and equals one hour travel on Starships.

## Running the Application

* You can run the console application named StarWars.UI.exe from StarWars.UI/bin/Release folder

* A distance in MGLT must be entered

* All StarShips will be displayed with their respective ressupply distances

## Components

The appllication was designed considering some principles:
* Separation of Concerns - modularized components
* Single Responsibility - components with unique responsability
* Backend - an information manager; API outline
* Frontend - a console application that can be repleced using same backend structure
